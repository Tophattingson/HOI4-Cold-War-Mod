 britain_winter.0.d:0 "The winter of 1946 - 1947 was harsh across all of Europe, but the United Kingdom is facing additional pressures. Extensive snowfall have blocked transportation infrastructure throughout the country, and transport of coal has broke down. Energy use restrictions are in effect, and the economy has been brought to a standstill."
 britain_winter.0.a:0 "We will have to wait this weather out."
 britain_winter.1.t:0 "Who is to blame for the Winter disruption?"
 britain_winter.1.d:0 "There is broad agreement among the public and politicians that the disruption to energy supplies this winter should not have happened. People are already looking to blame the Minister of Fuel and Power, Emanuel Shinwell, for the disruptions, but he denies the allegations. He has claimed that the cause of the disruption is the railway system, and the failures of Capitalism in general. He has recieved death threats, and is currently under police protection. We can let them blame him, if we want."
 britain_winter.1.a:0 "Scapegoat him."
 britain_winter.1.b:0 "The entire government must accept responsibility."
