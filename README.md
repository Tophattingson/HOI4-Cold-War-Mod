# HOI4-Cold-War-Mod

## Introduction

The premise of this mod is that the US never embarked on the Manhattan project, and therefore did not develop nuclear weapons and use them during WWII. This leads to several key changes to the world by the start date of 1947.

* The United States invaded and occupied parts of Japan in Operation Downfall from November 1945 through April 1946, at great cost. Simultaneously, the Soviet Union occupied all of Korea. 
* World War II ended in June 1946 with a Japanese surrender after the complete destruction of the countries military infrastructure.
* The political situation in Europe remains indeterminate, as both Soviet and American attention has been divided by the continuation of WWII against Japan.
* The costs of war have lead to a recession in the US and a famine in the USSR.

## Development objectives

The goal of this mod is to maintain gameplay that is very similar to that of Vanilla HOI4 while presenting an alternative geopolitical scenario. For example, technology and unit types will remain largely unchanged apart from changing the dates at which they become avaliable.

For national focuses, we have two design goals. Firstly, focus trees will have less generic industrial, military or research bonuses as compared to vanilla. They won't be entirely absent, but political decisions will take centre-stage. Secondly, focus trees will face more time pressure. The USSR and USA (and to a lesser extent France and the UK) will have to rush for influence in various countries in Europe and beyond before the other superpower can take a dominant position. Once either superpower has dominant influence over a country, it will become more difficult for the other superpower to take their own influence focuses there. For example, the USA cannot give Marshall Aid to a country that is already Communist. As the European situation solidifies, the USA and USSR will look to Asia, Africa and eventually even South America to aquire new allies. Additionally, in the case that both superpowers compete for the same country, an influence arms race can occur, and they may find themselves overcommitting for too little gain.

## Plan for V0.1 Release

* Starting country borders for 1947 set up.
* Preliminary focus trees for the USA, USSR, France and UK
* Decolonization events
* Resolution of the Occupation of Germany and Austria
